                <p>It is often said beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but many people mistakenly believe that to refer only to people. Natural beauty comes in many forms, and it is not about perfection. Beauty is not tarnished by imperfections â€“ it is defined by them. It could be in a smile, or the twinkle of an eye. It could be an untainted landscape, or the change of the seasons. It could even be in an act of pure unselfishness. Beauty comes in many, often unexpected forms, but it does not always announce itself. Sometimes you have to search for it, but when you find it, you will know it was worth it.</p>

                <p>The power, ingenuity, and sheer beauty found in nature has always fascinated mankind. When we look at powerful ocean waves rolling in, we cannot help but feel small and powerless in comparison. Mighty trees in a vast forest inspire feelings of insignificance and awe. Animal mothers taking care of their young make us question the cruelty with which we sometimes treat one another.</p>

                <p>The truth is, nature can teach us many valuable lessons. It can also lead us to wonder, did this beautiful earth with all of its natural treasures come about by chance or was it created?</p>

                <p>When we take the time to examine the beauty of the world around us, we are able to see parallels within our own lives. One who in tune with nature is in tune with the practice of living. Nature moves in a spiral as do our personal lives. It is important to spend time in nature because in this way we can become aware of its wisdom. If we ignore the beauty of nature and spend all our time in an urban jungle, our stress levels go up and we begin to feel as if we are made out of the concrete that we see all around us.</p>

                <h2>Nature in Poetry</h2>

                <p>Nature has been a recurring theme in poetry through the ages. Its various landscapes, its changing seasons, its creative as well as destructive power, its beautiful phenomenons; have fascinated poets of every generation stimulating them to create verses on it.</p>

                <div class="poem left">
                    <h3>William Wordsworth</h3>
                <pre>
    Thy nature is not therefore less divine:
    Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year;
    And worship'st at the Temple's inner shrine,
    God being with thee when we know it not. 
                </pre>
                </div>

                <p>Romanticism was an influential artistic and literary movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century and peaked in the first half of the 19th century. Among other things, glorification of nature was an integral part of Romanticism. Among the best known nature poets, including William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats were part of the Romantic movement. The theme of nature was one of the prominent themes in the poetry of several major 19th century poets including Alfred Lord Tennyson and Emily Dickinson; while the most important nature poets of the 20th century include Robert Frost and Mary Oliver. Here are the 10 most famous nature poets and their best known works.</p>
