                <p>New Bulgarian University was established on 18 September 1991 with a resolution by Bulgarian Parliament. The National Evaluation and Accreditation Agency, which reviews Bulgaria’s higher education teaching, granted NBU maximum accreditation in three consecutive accreditations in 2001, 2006, 2012 and 2019. Since 2004, NBU is an accredited partner of the Open University UK.</p>

                <p>New Bulgarian University pioneered the introduction in Bulgaria of a credit system, Professional Bachelor’s, Bachelor’s and Master’s programs, distance and continuing education.  The list of NBU Honorary Doctors and Honorary Professors include individuals of international renown such as Richard Rorty, Vera Mutafchieva, Julia Kristeva, Jean-Pierre Vernant, Milcho Leviev, Robert Young, Raina Kabaivanska, Lord Ralf Darendorf, Terry Eagleton, Geert Hofstede, Daniel Libeskind, Ennio Morricone etc.</p>


                <h2>Buildings</h2>

                <p>The university consists of three buildings altogether. A large part of the lecture halls and laboratories are in building 1. It is the office of the Honorary Chairman (President), Chairman of the Board, Executive Director, Rector, Vice-Rectors, as well as the offices of the faculties: School of General Studies, School of Undergraduate Studies and School of Graduate Studies.</p>

                <p>In this building there are also the Student Center and Publishing Center, a bookstore and some of the offices of the departments and the research communities at NBU. The Aula is the place for official ceremonies and academic activities. Students, teachers, guests and administration staff can relax in a spacious café-bar.

It is equipped with a multimedia projector, screen, computer, sound system, wireless and stationary microphones, a portable simultaneous interpretation system and a piano. The places for the audience are arranged in tiers in two sectors; in the central part of the stage are the sign of New Bulgarian University and its motto Ne varietatem timeamus. The Aula is a place for official academic ceremonies like the opening of the academic year, graduation ceremonies, the conferring of honorary titles, etc. Thanks to its hi-tech cinema projector every Thursday it becomes a cinema club.
